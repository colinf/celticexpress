## About

express-coffee is a template or boiler-plate to get started writting 
express web applications in CoffeeScript.  It comes ready to go with base
setup for an Express Web App.  It includes a Cakefile that lets you build, 
spec, and watch your coffeescript as you develop.  You hack in the src folder
and run cake build to build you server files, write your jasmine tests in
your spec folder and run cake spec to run your test suite.  Create your
coffeekup views in the views folder and put your public assets in the public
folder.  Enjoy your express-coffee
